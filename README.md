# BDP-Final-Project

  Christian Moronta (my deliverables are in this repository), Ivan Escalona, Oserieman Ivbaze, and Bryan Davidson. Link to       dataset located in final report.  

# Steps for running code
  1) Make sure to download necessary packages: numpy, matplotlib, and pandas
  2) Run Ivan_PreProc.ipynb to create preprocessed csv data
  3) Run all code sequentially in ChristianMorontaProjectQuestions.ipynb once the second step is completed.
